# Proseris Converted Theme

This theme was generated automatically from your uploaded ZIP.
What it does on activation:
- Registers a "Primary" menu.
- Creates Pages for each detected HTML file and assigns them to a Primary menu.
- Attempts to set "Home" (or the first page) as the static front page.
- Enqueues original CSS/JS found under /assets/css and /assets/js.

How to use:
1. Upload and activate this theme in Appearance → Themes.
2. Go to Appearance → Menus to tweak the Primary menu (if needed).
3. Pages were created automatically; edit their content as desired.
4. If styles or scripts don't load, confirm your CSS/JS file names exist under /assets/css and /assets/js.
5. If your original assets used deep folders or hashed names, you may need to adjust enqueueing or update references.

Notes:
- The static HTML from your original files is embedded into template-parts/pages/*.php.
- For fully dynamic headers/footers, you can refactor the generated template parts into header.php/footer.php manually.
